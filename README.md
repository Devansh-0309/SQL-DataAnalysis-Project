## Overview
Data Analysis is used to get the insights about the buisness. This helps us to understand the key features affecting the buisness.

## Techniques

### 1. Change Over Time Analysis
This is a technique where we find out the trends in the buisness growing with time. for e.g sales by year
We use the formuale [**Measure**] By [**Date Dimension**]

### 2. Cumulative Analysis
This is a technique where we find the measures progressing over time. for e.g running total by sales
We use the formulae [**Cumulative Measure**] By [**Date Dimension**]

### 3. Performance Analysis
This is a technique where we compare the current value of a part to its target value. for e.g current sales by previous sales
We use the formulae [**Current Measure**] By [**target Measure**]

### 4. Part To Whole Analysis
This is a technique where we compare a part of the measure to the whole part. for e.g particular category total contribution
We use the formulae ([**Measure**] / [**Total Measure**]) * 100 By [**Dimension**]

### 5. Data Segmentation
This is a technique Where we segment the measures to a dimension and then perform analysis on that. For e.g segment customers to (VIP, regular etc.)
We use two [**Measure**] By [**Measure**]
